            <td>Who hasn’t wondered what Pride and Prejudice would look like
              written from Mr. Darcy’s perspective? An Assembly Such As This
              explores just that. When Fitzwilliam Darcy visits his friend
              Charles Bingley in Hertfordshire, he doesn’t expect to unwillingly
              fall in love. Especially not with Elizabeth Bennet, to whom his
              attraction is…complicated. And to make matters worse, his old
              nemesis George Wickham has taken an interest in Elizabeth, too.
              This novel takes the classic love story and gives it a fresh voice
              as readers view it through Mr. Darcy’s eyes.</td>
