              Pride and Prejudice, romantic novel by Jane Austen, published
              anonymously in three volumes in 1813. A classic of English
              literature, written with incisive wit and superb character
              delineation, it centres on the burgeoning relationship between
              Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and
              Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. Upon
              publication, Pride and Prejudice was well received by critics and
              readers. The first edition sold out within the first year, and it
              never went out of print.

              Pride and Prejudice is set in rural England at the turn of the
              19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which includes
              five very different sisters. The eldest, Jane, is sweet-tempered
              and modest. She is her sister Elizabeth’s confidant and friend.
              Elizabeth, the heroine of the novel, is intelligent and
              high-spirited. She shares her father’s distaste for the
              conventional views of society as to the importance of wealth and
              rank. The third daughter, Mary, is plain, bookish, and pompous,
              while Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest, are flighty and immature.

              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                Mr. Bennet is the family patriarch. He is fond of his two eldest
                daughters—especially his favourite, Elizabeth—but takes a
                passive interest in the younger ones, ultimately failing to curb
                their childish instincts. An intelligent but eccentric and
                sarcastic man, he does not care for society’s conventions and
                mocks his wife’s obsession with finding suitable husbands for
                their daughters. As several scholars have noted, however, Mrs.
                Bennet is rightfully concerned. Because of an entail, the modest
                family estate is to be inherited by William Collins, Mr.
                Bennet’s nephew, who is the next male in line. Indeed, as Austen
                scholar Mary Evans noted, “If Mrs. Bennett is slightly crazy,
                then perhaps she is so because she perceives more clearly than
                her husband the possible fate of her five daughters if they do
                not marry.” Unfortunately, Mrs. Bennet’s fervour and indelicacy
                often work against her interests. A woman of little sense and
                much self-pity, she indulges her lively youngest daughters.

              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                Throughout the novel, the Bennet sisters encounter several
                eligible bachelors, including Charles Bingley, Darcy, Lieutenant
                George Wickham, and Collins. Bingley has recently let
                Netherfield estate, which neighbours the Bennets’ home,
                Longbourn. Austen describes him as “good-looking and
                gentlemanlike; [having] a pleasant countenance and easy,
                unaffected manners.” He has come by his fortune through his
                family’s interest in trade, which was seen as a less respectable
                means of obtaining wealth than by inheriting it, as his friend
                Darcy has done. Darcy is clearly a product of this hierarchical
                thinking: he believes in the natural superiority of the wealthy
                landed gentry. He is arrogant but perceptive.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                Darcy’s estates were once managed by Wickham’s father, but he
                and Wickham are no longer friendly. Wickham is attractive and
                charming, making him immediately popular among the women in the
                nearby town of Meryton, where he and other soldiers have been
                stationed. Collins, on the other hand, is “not a sensible man,
                and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by
                education or society.” He is a clergyman whose patron, the
                controlling Lady Catherine de Bourgh, is Darcy’s aunt.

                Other supporting characters in the novel include Elizabeth’s
                friend Charlotte Lucas, who is described as sensible and nearing
                an age where marriage is unlikely; Charlotte’s parents, Sir
                William and Lady Lucas; Mrs. Bennet’s brother, Edward Gardiner,
                who works in trade, and his wife, both of whom are generous and
                well-grounded; Bingley’s sisters, the snobbish and scheming
                Caroline and Louisa Hurst; and Darcy’s 16-year-old sister,
                Georgiana, who is painfully shy but good-humoured.

                Summary
              </a>
              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                The novel opens with one of the most famous lines in English
                literature: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a
                single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a
                wife.” The statement is seemingly what Mrs. Bennet thinks as she
                sets her sights on the newly arrived Bingley, who she is sure
                will make a suitable husband for one of her daughters. At a
                ball, Bingley takes an immediate interest in the beautiful and
                shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth
                is less cordial. Although Austen shows them intrigued by each
                other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: the
                pride of rank and fortune and prejudice against the social
                inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while the
                pride of self-respect and prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery
                hold Elizabeth equally aloof.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                The pompous Collins soon arrives, hoping to marry one of the
                Bennet sisters. Mrs. Bennet steers him toward Elizabeth, but the
                latter refuses his offer of marriage. He instead becomes engaged
                to her friend Charlotte. During this time, Elizabeth encounters
                the charming Wickham. There is a mutual attraction between the
                two, and he informs her that Darcy has denied him his
                inheritance.
              </p>
              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                After Bingley abruptly departs for London, Elizabeth’s dislike
                of Darcy mounts as she becomes convinced that he is discouraging
                Bingley’s relationship with Jane. Darcy, however, has grown
                increasingly fond of Elizabeth, admiring her intelligence and
                vitality. While visiting the now-married Charlotte, Elizabeth
                sees Darcy, who professes his love for her and proposes. A
                surprised Elizabeth refuses his offer, and, when Darcy demands
                an explanation, she accuses him of breaking up Jane and Bingley
                and of denying Wickham his inheritance. Darcy subsequently
                writes Elizabeth a letter in which he explains that he separated
                the couple largely because he did not believe Jane returned
                Bingley’s affection. He also discloses that Wickham, after
                squandering his inheritance, tried to marry Darcy’s then
                15-year-old sister in an attempt to gain possession of her
                fortune. With these revelations, Elizabeth begins to see Darcy
                in a new light.

              <p class="sub-paragraphs">
                Shortly thereafter the youngest Bennet sister, Lydia, elopes
                with Wickham. The news is met with great alarm by Elizabeth,
                since the scandalous affair—which is unlikely to end in
                marriage—could ruin the reputation of the other Bennet sisters.
                When she tells Darcy, he persuades Wickham to marry Lydia,
                offering him money. Despite Darcy’s attempt to keep his
                intervention a secret, Elizabeth learns of his actions. At the
                encouragement of Darcy, Bingley subsequently returns, and he and
                Jane become engaged. Finally, Darcy proposes again to Elizabeth,
                who this time accepts.

                The work, which Austen initially titled First Impressions, is
                the second of four novels that Austen published during her
                lifetime. Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for
                its lack of historical context (it is likely set either during
                the French Revolution [1787–99] or the Napoleonic Wars
                [1799–1815]), the existence of its characters in a social bubble
                that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate
                portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived.
                She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and
                prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same
                time, she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most
                perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered
                that the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for
                its happy denouement. In the end, Austen’s novel has remained
                popular largely because of Elizabeth—who was reportedly Austen’s
                own favourite among all her heroines—and because of the enduring
                appeal to men and women alike of a well-told and potentially
                happily ending love story.
