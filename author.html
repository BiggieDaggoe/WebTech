              Jane Austen, the author of the book Pride and Prejudice, is one
              of the most notable literary figures of all time, because her
              stories featured romance, irony, and even social commentary. But
              even if you've read all of her classic novels, there's a lot
              more to know about this talented author.

              Jane Austen (born December 16, 1775, Steventon, Hampshire,
              England—died July 18, 1817, Winchester,
              Hampshire) was an English writer who first gave the novel its
              distinctly modern character through her
              treatment of ordinary people in everyday life. She published four
              novels during her lifetime: Sense and
              Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park
              (1814), and Emma (1815). In these and in
              Persuasion and Northanger Abbey (published together posthumously,
              1817), she vividly depicted English
              middle-class life during the early 19th century. Her novels
              defined the era’s novel of manners, but they
              also became timeless classics that remained critical and popular
              successes for over two centuries after her
              death. These works reflect her enduring legacy.

              The English novelist wrote about unremarkable people in
              unremarkable situations of everyday life, and yet she
              shaped such material into remarkable works of art. The economy,
              precision, and wit of her prose style; the
              shrewd, amused sympathy expressed toward her characters; and the
              skillfulness of her characterization and
              storytelling continue to enchant readers.

              Jane Austen was the seventh of eight children. Her closest
              companion throughout her life was her elder sister,
              Cassandra. Their father was a scholar who encouraged the love of
              learning in his children, and their mother was
              a woman of ready wit, famed for her impromptu verses and stories.
              The great family amusement was acting.

              Her earliest known writings date from about 1787, and between then
              and 1793 she wrote a large body of material that has survived in
              three manuscript notebooks: Volume the First, Volume the Second,
              and Volume the Third. These contain plays, verses, short novels,
              and other prose and show Austen engaged in the parody of existing
              literary forms, notably the genres of the sentimental novel and
              sentimental comedy. Her passage to a more serious view of life
              from the exuberant high spirits and extravagances of her earliest
              writings is evident in Lady Susan, a short epistolary novel
              written about 1793–94 (and not published until 1871). This
              portrait of a woman bent on the exercise of her own powerful mind
              and personality to the point of social self-destruction is, in
              effect, a study of frustration and of woman’s fate in a society
              that has no use for her talents.

              Austen was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning
              signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable,
              and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of
              biographers rely on Zachary Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis
              and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her
              final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's
              lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his
              wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a
              relapse, writing:
              "I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves."

              Austen continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied
              with the ending of The Elliots, she rewrote the final two
              chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817,
              Austen began The Brothers (titled Sanditon when published in
              1925), completing twelve chapters before stopping work in
              mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes Sanditon's
              heroine, Diana Parker, as an "energetic invalid". In the novel
              Austen mocked hypochondriacs, and although she describes the
              heroine as "bilious", five days after abandoning the novel she
              wrote of herself that she was turning "every wrong colour" and
              living "chiefly on the sofa". She put down her pen on 18 March
              1817, making a note of it.

              Austen made light of her condition, describing it as "bile" and
              rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty
              walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed.
              In May, Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for
              treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed
              death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817 at the age of 41.
              Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister
              to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester
              Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises
              Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and
              mentions the "extraordinary endowments of her mind", but does not
              explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.

              <div class="text-within-fun-facts">
                There is no mention of war in any of her novels. However, you
                might be surprised to hear that Jane Austen actually served in
                the military as a senior officer in the 4th Women's Battalion,
                King Royal's Hussars. She even saw active service at Ulm in
                1805.

              <div class="text-within-fun-facts">
                She had two sweeping (tragically-ending) love affairs, and one
                unrequited marriage proposal in 1802. Jane agreed to marry
                Harris Bigg-Wither, the 21-year-old heir of a Hampshire family,
                but the next morning changed her mind.

                Jane Austen's brother Henry was the one that revealed her true
                identity.
